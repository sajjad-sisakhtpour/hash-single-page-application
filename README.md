## Overview

The **Hash Single Page Application (SPA)** demonstrates how to create a simple state-based navigation system using URL hash fragments in JavaScript. This app allows users to navigate between different sections, such as Home, Search, Likes, and Profile, all within a single page without reloading the entire page. By using the `hashchange` event listener, this project implements a hash-based routing system for single-page applications.

This project serves as a great example for developers who are interested in learning about client-side routing and how to manage state changes based on URL fragments.

## Features

- **Hash-based Routing**: Utilizes the `hashchange` event to change the page state without full page reloads.
- **Dynamic UI**: The content and background color update based on the selected hash fragment.
- **Simple Navigation**: Navigation links are represented by icons, each corresponding to a different section of the app.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sajjad-sisakhtpour/hash-single-page-application.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd hash-single-page-application
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser**:
   - The app will run directly in your browser without needing any additional configuration or server.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your browser.
2. You will see four navigation links (`H`, `S`, `L`, `P`), representing Home, Search, Likes, and Profile sections.
3. Clicking on any of these links will update the URL hash and change the content displayed on the page.
4. Each section will have its own background color, making it easy to distinguish between them.
5. The page title (shown in `<h1>`) will also update to reflect the selected section.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how the app works:

- **Home**: Clicking on the "H" link changes the background color to red and updates the title to "home".
- **Search**: Clicking on the "S" link changes the background color to pink and updates the title to "search".
- **Likes**: Clicking on the "L" link changes the background color to green and updates the title to "likes".
- **Profile**: Clicking on the "P" link changes the background color to yellow and updates the title to "profile".
